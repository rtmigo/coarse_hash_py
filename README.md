# [fast_file_hash](https://github.com/rtmigo/fast_file_hash_py)

Calculates fast hashes of files, not reading the entire data, but snatching
individual bytes.

This package is hastily made, barely documented, and is not intended to be used
by anyone.

# Install

``` bash
$ pip3 install git+https://github.com/rtmigo/fast_file_hash_py#egg=fast_file_hash
```
